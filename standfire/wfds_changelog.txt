-modified the WFDS class constructor to accept x dimension Area Of
	Interest (AOI) and the x Offset (fetch or the distance between
	the x minimum and the x AOI minimum).

- removed hard-wired values from the constructor and used the AOI and 
	Offset to calculate the center point of the AOI (aoa_x_center)
