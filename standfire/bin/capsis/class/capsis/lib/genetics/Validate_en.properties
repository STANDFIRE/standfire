## Validate labels - English

## AreGeneticDataCompatible
Validate.in = in
Validate.species = for species
Validate.IGFormat = all IndividualGenotype have not same size
Validate.ADDefined = AlleleDiversity must be given in inventory file 
Validate.MGFormat = all MultiGenotype have not same size
Validate.IG-MGFormat = IndividualGenotype and MultiGenotype have not compatible size
Validate.IG-ADFormat = AlleleDiversity and IndividualGenotype have not compatible size
Validate.lineAD = there is error in AlleleDiversity in locus 
Validate.nuclearDNA = of nuclear DNA
Validate.MCytoDNA = of maternal cytoplamsic DNA
Validate.PCytoDNA = of paternal cytoplamsic DNA
Validate.MG-ADFormat = AlleleDiversity and MultiGenotype have not compatible size
Validate.AE-ADFormat = AlleleDiversity and AlleleEffect have not compatible size
Validate.AEvalues = The array of effects of parameter
Validate.givenAEvalues = are empty. They must be given in inventory file.
Validate.HTev = the heritability and total environmental variance of parameter
Validate.givenHTev = are unkown. At least, one must be given in inventory file
Validate.%Variance = the part of inter Step environmental variance of parameter
Validate.given%Variance = must be given in inventory file

# Validate
Validate.defaultAD = default AlleleDiversity has been calculated
Validate.defaultIG = unknown IndividualGenotype (all allele equal to -1) has been calculated and replace empty IndividualGenotype
Validate.defaultMG = default MultiGenotype has been calculated and replace empty MultiGenotype
Validate.defaultGeneticMap = default GeneticMap has been calculated
Validate.completeAE = AlleleEffect has been completed: the value of heritability (or total environmental variance ) equalt to à -1 in inventory file has been replaced by default value

# CompleteInitialData
Validate.completeAD = AlleleDiversity has been completed to add allele -1 in the locus where it was not
Validate.completeMG = MultiGenotype has been completed to add the frequence of allele -1in the locus where it was not
Validate.completeAE = AlleleEffect has been completed to add the effect of allele -1 in each locus which have an influence on the parameter
