EconomicModelTool.errorWhileLoadingSettings  = Error while loading file
EconomicModelTool.confirm = Would like to close this window ?
EconomicModelTool.confirmClose = Would like to close this window ?
EconomicModelTool.dateExplanation1 = The given date will refer to stand after intervention. \n For example, if 2010 is chosen as first year, then all income, expanse and intervention \n that occur in 2010 will be included in the scenario.
EconomicModelTool.dateExplanation2 = The events occurring that year will be included in the transitory period \n and not be included in the cyclic period. 
EconomicModelTool.dateExplanation3 = The given date will refer to stand after intervention. \n For example, if 2010 is chosen as last year, then all income, expanse and intervention \n that occur in 2010 will be included in the scenario.

EconomicTextViewer.forestValue = Estimation of forest value
EconomicTextViewer.cashFlows = Cash flow summary
EconomicTextViewer.profitability = Profitability indicators 
EconomicTextViewer.BASIExplanation2 = Computing the net present value of an infinite cycle assumes that the values of the stand at the beginning of the inifinite cycle is identical to the stand at the end of the infinite cycle. \n This assumption can be checked looking at the stand description at appropriate dates with appropriate model data extractor. \n FEV is therefore not computed for transitory period.
EconomicTextViewer.BASITransitoryPeriod = The net present value of an infinite cycle cannot be computed for a transitory period
