<strong>F</strong>ire management requires the consideration of vegetation as a potential fuel, not only from the botanistsâ€™ point of view. Forest managers like to determine the consequences of silvicultural and fuel treatments on potential fire risk. The National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA) in Avignon, France, is in the process of developing a European fuel and fire effects assessment system to make it possible to analyse the relationships between vegetation characteristics, fire behaviour and post-fire impact on vegetation.

<p>
Fire Paradox Fuel Manager is a key application in the fire modeling process with the following major objectives:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> to generate vegetation scenes in 3D to be used as input data for fire behaviour;</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> to allow analysis of fire effects visualisation on shrubs and trees;</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> to visualise post fire vegetation coupled with plant growth model.</div>
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h3 class="sectionedit263" id="innovative_aspects">Innovative aspects</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
3D spatial distribution of plants can now be considered in the new fire models. Likewise, the thermal, physical and chemical properties of any plant elements can be constructed. Fuel Manager is a powerful software enabling representation of any vegetation community in the landscape in a user-friendly manner, simultaneously integrating the required attributes for running complex fire simulation in the background.
</p>

<p>
It can be installed locally on a PC and connects automatically to a remote database on vegetation fuels. It has also been developed on a tree growth and forest stand dynamics modeling platform, entailing simulation of vegetation growth with and without fire events.
