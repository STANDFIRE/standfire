<p>
The present project aims at analyzing the dynamic of uneven-aged acidophile medio-European beech forests. Such forest type represents a key habitat on an environmental aspect (Natura 2000 priority habitat), as well as on an economic and societal aspects. 
</p>

<p>
While forest management has achieved regular timber production, it has rarely succeeded in promoting a diversified natural regeneration. It contributes, however, to biodiversity, resiliency and sustainability of this ecosystem to climate hazards, pest and diseases. Furthermore, scientific understandings are still missing in order to draw up multifunctional management plans objectively. In view of this, our objective is to refine our knowledge about the functioning of this environment using a modelling approach. 
</p>

<p>
A set of consistent models will be carried out to describe main processes that contribute to its dynamic: they include the development of natural regeneration, the growth of trees, and natural mortality. These processes will be handled through semi-empirical models, mechanistic models, and autecologic models. Contrary to most studies on forest dynamic, our approach does not focus on a particular situation. We rather use a holistic approach incorporating all important elements of the ecosystem. The results should therefore be widely applicable. 
</p>

<p>
This will be achieved thanks to the existence of a large in situ experiment and to the monitoring of permanent plots. The models are implemented in a computer simulation platform (Capsis) in order to perform prospective analysis by simulation. These developments should allow us to study the evolution of the structure and composition of the beech forests under different scenarios combining natural constraints and forestry or hunting management plans.
