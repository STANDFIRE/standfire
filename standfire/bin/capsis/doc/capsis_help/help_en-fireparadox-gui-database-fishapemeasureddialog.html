<h2 class="sectionedit291" id="shape_creation_for_a_measured_plant">SHAPE CREATION FOR A MEASURED PLANT</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
A measured plant has been sampled in fields. 
</p>

Fill the following options :

<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Sampling method : cube or cage</div>

</ul>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> shape kind : 2D, 2 * 2D, 3D</div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Voxels, sample and shape dimensions in cm : height (Z), main diameter (X), perpendicular diameter (Y)</div>
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h5 id="cube_method">CUBE METHOD</h5>
<div class="level5">

<p>
For the cube method, first you will have to build a sample composed of a cube column. Each cube can be T (Top) C (Center) B (Bottom) type, each type having a particle list and measured biomasses.
</p>

<p>
Then you will build the 2D or 3D shape, using cubes from the sample. 
</p>

<p>
Usually a measured plant with cube method is composed of a sample, a 2D shape and a 3D shape.
</p>

</div>

<h5 id="cage_method">CAGE METHOD</h5>
<div class="level5">

<p>
For the cage method, first you will have to build a 3D sample composed of cubes, all diffferents.
</p>

<p>
Then the 3D shape will be â€¦.
</p>

<p>
Usually a measured plant with cage method is composed of a 3D sample, and a 3D shape.
</p>

</div>

<h5 id="samples">SAMPLES</h5>
<div class="level5">

<p>
When a sample exists, it is no more possible to modify voxel sizes. 
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to have several samples for the same plant, except if some of them are desactivated. 
</p>

</div>

<h5 id="d_or_2_2d_shapes">2D or 2*2D shapes</h5>
<div class="level5">

<p>
These shapes are available only for the cube method. 
</p>

<p>
These shapes are optionnal and are usefull only to help users to build the 3D shape. 
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to have several 2D shapes for the same plant, except if some of them are desactivated. 
</p>

<p>
For 2D shape, only one slice of voxels will be stored (front view). 
</p>

<p>
For 2*2D shape, 2 slices of voxels will be stored (front and perpendicular view).
</p>

</div>

<h5 id="d_shape">3D SHAPE</h5>
<div class="level5">

<p>
<strong>3D simple</strong> : If there is a 2D shape or a sample, cubes will be initially put in the middle of the 3D shape.
For the cube method, user will have to fill the all 3D shape with the sample cubes.
For the cage method, user will have to fill the all 3D shape with different cubes and biomasses.
</p>

<p>
<strong>3D from 2D</strong> : Only for cube method, if one 2D shape exists.
A rotation algotithm generate automatically the 3D shape.
The final 3D shape will no longer be composed of T/C/B cubes, biomasses will be meaning values depending of cube distance from the rotztion axe.
