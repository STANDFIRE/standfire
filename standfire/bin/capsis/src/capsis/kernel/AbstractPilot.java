/**	AbstractPilot is a superclass for all Capsis pilots.
 * 	A pilot deals with a context of use of Capsis. The 'gui' pilot
 * 	opens a main window with menus and a graphical project manager, it
 * 	can be used to run simulations interactively. The 'script' pilot 
 * 	opens no windows and executes the script given in parameter, most 
 * 	of the tasks that can be run with 'gui' can also be run with 'script'.
 * 	Other pilots can be written to run simulations in other ways.
 * 	The pilot is constructed by the Engine from its name: 'gui' -> 
 * 	applicationPackageName.gui.Pilot (convention).
 * 	The capsis.script.Pilot can be used in other applications to run scripts.
