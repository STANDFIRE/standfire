/** A simple utility class that lets you very simply print
 *  an arbitrary component. Just pass the component to the
 *  PrintUtilities.printComponent. The component you want to
 *  print doesn't need a print method and doesn't have to
 *  implement any interface or do anything special at all.
 *  <P>
 *  If you are going to be printing many times, it is marginally more 
 *  efficient to first do the following:
 *  <PRE>
 *    PrintUtilities printHelper = new PrintUtilities(theComponent);
 *  </PRE>
 *  then later do printHelper.print(). But this is a very tiny
 *  difference, so in most cases just do the simpler
 *  PrintUtilities.printComponent(componentToBePrinted).
