July, 2017 changelog for standfire version 1.1.0a (from version 1.0.0a)

SCRIPTS

*******************************
* standfire_mini_interface.py *
*******************************

-added import for new lidar (lidar.py) module

-added lidar_get_shapefile method. Opens file dialog and stores user
	selected filename in lidar_entry box.

-added 'filetype' option to get_keyword_file method to restrict displayed
	files to *.key or *.*.

-added toggle_ldr_check method. Checks whether the 'Enable LiDAR Run box
	is checked, enables or disables GUI elements as appropriate and 
	populates/depopulates GUI entry fields as appropriate.

-modified update_domain_change method:
	-removed hard-wired numbers to accomadate both standard and lidar
	 simulations.
	-added x & y Area Of Interest (AOI) variable for use in calculating
	 x & y offsets.
	-added y offset variable
	-added pathways to calculate various dimensions for both standard 
	 and lidar runs.
	-changed the methodology for calculating WFDS igniter location and
	 dimensions.

- added run_button method. Runs either a standard or lidar FVS simulation 
	method (run_standard or run_lidar) depending on user specification.
	Also runs run_etal which runs CAPSIS and WFDS for either type of 
	simulation.

-split the run method into run_standard and capsis_etal methods and added the
	run_lidar method.
	The run_lidar method processes the input shapefile, runs multiple
	64 x 64m FVS simulations and collates the FVS simulation results.

-modified the capsis_etal (formally a part of the run method) to 1) set the 
	'extend' parameter for capsis to True (standard run) or False 
	(lidar run) and 2) to pass on new variables required by the WFDS class
	constructor (__init__) method.

-added the following variables to the create_variables method:
	-ldr_check_var - t/f lidar run checkbox
	-lidar_shapefile - input lidar shapefile path and name
	-x_AOI_size - x Area Of Interest size
	-y_AOI_size - y AOI size

-added the following variables to the reset method:
	-lidar_check_var (uncheck)
	-lidar_shapefile (clear)
	-shape_entry (disable)
	-shp_brws_btn (disable)
	-x_entry (enable)
	-y_entry (enable)
	-x_AOI_size (64)
	-y_AOI_size (64)

-deleted the clear method. This method set all input variables to an empty
	string. This could cause some bugs in the program down the road and
	we decided to eliminate it.

-added the following to the GUI:
	-'Enable LiDAR Run' checkbox
	-'Specify LiDAR shapefile' string entry box
	-'Browse' button (to browse for LiDAR shapefile)

-added the the 'lidar panel' to the create_widgets method (includes the above
	GUI additions and associated text prompts)

-deleted the clear button from the create_widgets method (see above)

-added the lidar panel items (see above) to the grid_widgets method. Adjusted
	adjusted the positioning of other GUI elements as necessary.

-deleted the clear button from the grid_widgets method.


************************
* standfire_cmdline.py *
************************

Standfire command line has been completely rewritten. Only 10 lines of code 
remain from the original. Please see the comments in standfire_cmdline.py 
for a description of its operation.


*************
* capsis.py *
*************

-changed default parameter 'extend' (in 'params' dictionary) from true to false.
	This will prevent capsis from extrapolating new trees into areas outside
	the sample area. This is important for lidar data input which has real 
	data from edge to edge.This parameter can be reset using the 
	'set_extend_FVS_sample' method for standard runs.
    
- changed other default parameters to eliminate hard wired values including 
	sceneSizeX, sceneSizeY, xOffset and yOffset (changed to 0 or 0.0)

-changed default parameters for 'canopyGeom' and 'bdBin' to 'CYLINDER' and '0.01'
	from 'RECTANGLE' and '0.1' to accomidate the new version of CAPSIS' ability to 
	generate heterogeneous surface fuels.

-added 'layerGeom' as a new parameter and set it to 'HET_RECTANGLE_TEXT'. This will
	generate heterogeneous surface fuels in the new version of capsis.

-changed the default surface fuels parameters under 'srf_fuels' to match the defaults
	used in the standfire mini interface (standfire_mini_interface.py).

-corrected an error in capsis.py in the 'set_srf_dead_mc' method where litter moisture
	was being set to herbaceous moisture.

-combined RunConfig methods 'set_x_size' and 'set_y_size' to create 'set_xy_size'

-expanded 'set_xy_size' parameters to include x&y scene sizes and x&y AOI sizes.
	The AOI sizes are passed to the private methods '_set_x_offset', 
	'_set_y_offset' and '_set_block_verts' to calculate these parameters.
    
-modified the set x&y offset methods to add x&y AOI size parameters

-replaced hardwired parameters in the set x&y offset methods with formulas using 
	x&y AOI values to calculate these offsets.

-modified '_set_block_verts' method to add x&y AOI parameters and replace
	hardwired values with formulas to calculate the surface fuel blocks using
	these parameters.
   
-added set_extend_FVS_sample method to set extend to true when starting from FVS .tre
	file (standard run)


************
* fuels.py *
************

-No significant changes.


***********
* wfds.py *
***********

-modified the WFDS class constructor to accept x dimension Area Of
	Interest (AOI) and the x Offset (fetch or the distance between
	the x minimum and the x AOI minimum).

- removed hard-wired values from the constructor and used the AOI and 
	Offset to calculate the center point of the AOI (aoa_x_center)


************
* lidar.py *
************

- Entirely new sub module. Please see the comments in lidar.py for a
	description of its operation.
