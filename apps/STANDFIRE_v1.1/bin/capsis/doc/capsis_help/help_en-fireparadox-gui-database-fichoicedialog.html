<strong>EuroForestFuel database</strong> aims at storing different categories of fuels that can be displayed with the <strong>Fuel Manager</strong> for building vegetation scenes. Three fuel categories are considered:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Samples</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Plants</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Layers</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that these fuel categories may be either <strong>virtual</strong> or <strong>measured</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Fuels descriptions are provided by teams (mostly Fire Paradox partners) and are carried out in the field on sites that can be geographically located. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Team</strong> and <strong>Site</strong> are two levels of fuel data organization stored in the database. 
</p>

<p>
This menu provide access, according to right levels, for managing <strong>teams</strong>, <strong>sites</strong> and all types of <strong>fuels</strong>.

<p>
<strong>Fuel plant:</strong> vegetation object.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Measured plant:</strong> vegetation object corresponding to a real plant measured in the field.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Virtual plant:</strong> vegetation object not corresponding to real plant measured in the field. It may differ either by its shape, by the distribution of cubes within its shape, by the values of one or several fuel parameters (e.g. mean of several samples). 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Fuel layer:</strong> collection of individual plants, closely grouped and difficult to describe separately, forming a layer generally much more wide than high. A fuel layer is described as a single vegetation object and has almost the same properties than an individual plant. Quercus coccifera shrubland is a typical fuel layer.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Fuel sample:</strong> sample of fuel of a lower level than a vegetation object (individual plant). One or several fuel samples are necessary to build a vegetation object. Fuel sampling is generally carried out with the so called “cube” method, collecting fuel in elementary volumes of 25 cm side. Consequently a typical fuel sample is a 25 cm x 25 cm x 25 cm cube, although it may have other dimensions. A fuel sample may be collected by field destructive measurements (measured), or calculated.
