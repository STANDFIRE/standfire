<p>
Mountain is a model of forest dynamics designed to the study of stand structure / stand dynamics / silviculture interactions.
</p>

<p>
It can be used to compare thinning strategies and to understand how demographic processes at the tree level (regeneration, growth, death) generate patterns at the stand level.
</p>

<p>
As a spatial individual tree model, it is especially devoted to study spatial structure dynamics.

<div class="level2">

<p>
Mountain is a spatial individual tree model (Distance Dependent Tree Model).
</p>

<p>
Trees are characterized by their position (x, y, z), height, diameter at breath height, crown base height and crown base radius.
</p>

<p>
Plot is rectangular, with mean slope and aspect. It is divided in square cells (1 to 5 m. wide) characterised by the presence of regeneration.
</p>

<p>
Light interception is calculated for every tree and every cell taking into account stand structure, slope and aspect.
</p>

<p>
Growth, death and competition are modelled at the tree level for every individuals higher than 1.30 m. Regeneration is modelled at the ground cell level.
</p>

<p>
Tree height and diameter increments are calculated as the product of a potential increment by a reducer depending on the ratio between light intercepted by the tree and potential light intercepted by a tree of the same size in free growth.
</p>

<p>
Tree death is stochastic and depends on light ratio.
</p>

<p>
Seedling emergence, growth and death depend on light on cell surface.
