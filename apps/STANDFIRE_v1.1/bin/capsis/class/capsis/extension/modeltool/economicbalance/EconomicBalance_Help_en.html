<h1>&nbsp;CAPSIS Economic Balance (V1.1.1)</h1>
<h2>General information<br>
</h2>
The currency used for the
economic calculations was deliberately omitted, so that we can
associate a monetary cost to a forestry operation, but also a cost in
carbon tonnes or in a score. We hope to be able to develop in a near
future more sophisticated
functions for calculating costs and incomings, taking into account de
defaults, the shape, the branches, or even de chances of possible
biotic or non biotic damages...<br>
All the data captured&nbsp; within the economic assessment will be
safeguarded together with the project.<br>
A larger presentation of the this extension is available on the IEFC
website: <a
 href="http://www.iefc.net/index.php?affiche_page=projet_PROPRISK">www.iefc.net</a>
<h2>The window's title<br>
</h2>
&nbsp;
Shows the extension that is being used and the title of the step on
which the calculations can be done. <br>
<h2>The superior line<br>
</h2>
Informs about<br>
<ul>
  <li>the area to be used for modelling and for the calculations by
hectare.</li>
  <li>The period of study: the period used for the payment
calculations.
The beginning of this period can be defined bellow in the window, the
period ends always in the same year on which the assessment
occurs. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Left part<br>
</h2>
<h3>Table<br>
</h3>
This part allows us to display the list of steps on a table where
each line corresponds to a real intervention (clearings, ...)
or to artificial ones
(economic interventions) that do not affect the populations, so that we
can associate the costs and the incomings of each step. All the data
registered in each line is saved on the step that is being used. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;
By clicking on the right button of one of the lines a contextual menu
will appear that will allow us :
<ul>
  <li>To associate an expenditure to an intervention :
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed expenditure : Expenditure for which the amount is
introduced by the user, independently of the population or the area.</li>
      <li>Expenditure by hectare : Expenditure for which we know the
cost by hectare<br>
      </li>
      <li>[None] : Deletes the expenditure currently associated
with the step<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To associate an incoming to an expenditure :
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed incoming : Incoming for which the amount is introduced
by the user, independently of the population or the area.</li>
      <li>Incoming by m<sup>3</sup> : Incoming calculated by
multiplying the price of the cubic metre obtained trough the difference
of
volume given by the model (getV) before and after the intervention<br>
      </li>
      <li>Incoming by diameter class: the user fills in a table
associating&nbsp; the price to the lowest limit&nbsp; (including) of
the chosen diameter class. CAPSIS multiplies the volume of each tree
that has disappeared during this intervention (function getTreeV) by
the price given to the diameter class (function
getTreeV). The table with the prices can be saved in a XML file to be
downloaded later.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Incoming by girth class: the user fills in a
table associating the price to the lowest limit&nbsp;
(including) of the chosen girth class. CAPSIS multiplies the
volume of each tree that has disappeared during
this intervention (function getTreeV) by the price given to the girth
class (function
getTreeV). The table with the prices can be saved in a XML file to be
downloaded later.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To introduce a new line, considered as a neutral intervention
for the population (economic intervention) in order to associate an
incoming to an expenditure: all you have to do is to chose the year of
the intervention and to give it a name (for example 'cleaning') </li>
  <li>To delete a neutral intervention (economic intervention) </li>
</ul>
&nbsp;The incomings and expenditure columns show the result of the
calculation done for each intervention. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;<b>The incoming column shows the updated profit of the year in
which the intervention occurs</b> taking into account the incomings and
the expenditure of that year, but also the regular incomings and
expenditure registered on the right part.<br>
<h3>The line bellow the table<br>
</h3>
On the part bellow you can visualise the parameters that changed
into incoming or expenditure functions and that are associated with the
selected
intervention. <br>
<h2>The right part<br>
</h2>
This strans allows to register the incomings and the expenditure
that cannot be associated to an intervention on the population. Either
it is about the annual expenses, or the expenses that were previous to
the appearing of the modulated populations (soil preparation,
purification, ...). These expenses are common for all the branches of
the
project.
<h3>The line above<br>
</h3>
It allows us to save or to download the data registered on the table
of
the right part in a XML format. The XML format organises the data
in such a way that it is possible to save in the same file the
information
registered regularly on the right part and the price by diameter
category or circumference used in the left part.<br>
Once you have loaded or saved a file, the file name is registred so that you don't need to select it again. If you whish to use an other file, you have to clear the box with the file name.
<h3>Table<br>
</h3>
Resumes the regular incomings and expenses. For example, a tax that
only starts to be paid from the 21st year can be registered as follows:<br>
<table summary="" border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Beginning<br>
      </td>
      <td>End<br>
      </td>
      <td>Object<br>
      </td>
      <td>Incoming<br>
      </td>
      <td>Expenditure<br>
      </td>
      <td>Income<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>21</td>
      <td>100</td>
      <td>Tax<br>
      </td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>80</td>
      <td>-2160</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<br>
The dates for the beginning and end are only indicative, the period of
study is a priority for these indicators. If the studying period is
0-57, the "income" column will indicate the product of the incomings
minus the expenses multiplied by the total years that are taken into
account, being -2160 in this case. The incoming is not updated so that
the checking can be easier. <br>
<br>
It is possible to introduce operations that were previous to the
plantation by
choosing the same year for the beginning and the end. For example, for
taking into account in the economic calculations the soil preparation
that will take place in the year 0 and that costed 1000, the following
parameters must be filled in:
<table summary="" border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Beginning<br>
      </td>
      <td>End<br>
      </td>
      <td>Object<br>
      </td>
      <td>Incoming<br>
      </td>
      <td>Expenditure<br>
      </td>
      <td>Income<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>Soil preparation <br>
      </td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1000</td>
      <td>-1000</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
&nbsp;
By clicking on the right button a contextual menu will appear which
allows us:
<ul>
  <li>To introduce a new line before the selected one<br>
  </li>
  <li>To introduce a new line after the selected one<br>
  </li>
  <li>To delete the selected line<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>At the bottom of the economic balance<br>
</h2>
<h3>Changeable parameters<br>
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The updating rate: it is shown in&nbsp; %, and it is used for
calculating the updated profit and the updated profit of the infinite
series.</li>
  <li>The beginning of the period: the year that the period of the
payment calculations starts.</li>
</ul>
These parameters are applied to the all project and are used for the
calculations of the economic indicators that concern assessment and
displayers.
<h3>The economic indicators<br>
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Profit : the difference between the incomings and expenses
without the payments,</li>
  <li>Present profit: the profit on which it is applied the updated
rate of the project,</li>
  <li>Present profit of the infinite series: supposes that the scenario
will be forever, allowing us to compare the scenarios of different
length<br>
  </li>
  <li>Internal profit rate: allows us to compare a financial investment
and fixes the payment rate to be applied.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
The annual development of these indicators can be seen by using the
"Economic/time indicators" displayer, it is possible to chose the
variable that you are going to observe by clicking on the right button
on the contextual menu of the displayer : "Configuration". Be careful
with the interpretation!
