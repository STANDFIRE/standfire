Last changes in GeoLog :

*	13/10/2009	TreeUtil improvment (for DETimeRW)
*	04/06/2009	Minor improvements
- PieceViewer2D.drawPolygon : added drawLines option
- KnottyCoreProfile : interpolation made on radial width (was knotty core ratio)
- RadialProfile : treatment of interlaced rings removed (now returns null ring width)
- TreeUtil.getTreeHistory : intervention steps removed
- removed executable property for all source files

*	18/02/2009
- Fagacees : FgVolume.getBoisFortVolume modified for oak to be below 95% of total 
	volume for trees with c130>120 cm (was applied in GeoLog only)
- FgOakExpansionFactor : renamed FgExpansionFactor and extended to beech
	(thanks to Nicolas Toquard)
- FgSumSteps : corrected to work with beech

*	13/02/2009
- FgSumSteps : root mass added by Nicolas Robert
- FgBeech : several improvements by Nicolas Robert
- PieceYieldRecord : corrected several bugs in yield, mass and density of usable wood computation

*	17/10/2008
- RadialProfile : patch to get coherent results with invalid stem profiles 
 (e.g. inner rings at stem bottom with Fagacees beech)

*	03/09/2008
- added useful volumes for oak Furniture, Sawing, Stave (by Nicolas Robert)

*	02/09/2008	Version pour Nicolas Robert
- GeoLog : added to the outputs yield, useful volume and mass
  added FgBeech module
- FgUtil : added wood density model for beech
  corrected a bug in the wood density model for oak (for GeoLog outputs only)
- MethodProvider : added DiscMassProvider (used by wqw/GeoLog)

*	27/03/2008	Version pour Nicolas Robert
- GeoLog : crownRatio of the mixed stem/crown log used to ponderate the crown expansion factor
- GeoLogExport : results are now dispatched by tree status
- FgSumSteps : added volGeoLog_m3 (a volume coherent with GeoLog results)

*	29/01/2008
- TreeTab : added checkboxes for dead and/or cut trees
- FgSumSteps : new export for Fagacées giving living, dead and collected volumes 
  and masses for each step

*	24/08/2007
- PieceViewer2D : bug corrections
- PieceUtil : added methods for interpolating radius between 2 discs

*	13/11/2006	Version capsis4_fagacees-fm_2006-11-13 envoyée à Thierry Sardin
- GeoLogExport : modified the by-product output files (GeoLog_ONF, 
  GeoLog_DxP, GeoLog_AxP) to save average value in place of sum for 
  ring widths (rww_mm and rwchw_mm) [demand of Thierry Sardin]
- RecordMaker : added the abstract method finaliseSumRecord ()
- rewrited FgOakRecordMaker
- added class PiecePriceRecord

*	19/09/2006	Version finale pour Frauke
- FgOakAnnex : changed the model for estimating crown radius
  (used by GeoLog for sapwood estimation)
- GeoLogExport : GPiece.numberOfPieces is now used as a ponderation factor 
  in ByProductTable files (axp, dxp...) : SumVar = Sum (Var*numberOfPieces)
  (numberOfPieces = number of numberable trees, crown exp. fact. for FgOak)
- FgOakCrownExpansionFactor : changed the model for estimating 
  total BF (bois fort) volume

*	13/09/2006
- added tree status (dead, cut or alive) to GeoLog outputs
  (does not make sense for numberable trees)
- added class TreeStatusMaker

*	25/08/2006	Version capsis4_cvs_20060825a envoyée à Thierry Sardin
- added to FagaceesLogging outputs the crown expansion factor
  (in place of GPiece.numberOfPieces)
- added customisable log price models (E/m3) depending on diameter
  initialised to Sébastien Cavaignac 2003 models for oak products,
  to null value for other products
- added random attributes to the trees and required thresholds
  for each product (allowing to simulate quality requirements)
  (idea of Thierry Sardin)
- rewrited the GeoLogExport class :
  corrected a bug in median diameter output
  added ring width of clear duramen to the outputs
  added a new GeoLog_ONF output file (similar to GeoLog_DxP but 
  with diameter classes used by ONF)
- added classes GeoLogTreeData, FagLogOptionDialog (in progress),
  LogPriceModel, NumericRecord, PieceRingWidthRecord, 
  PieceVolumeRecord, RecordMaker, RecordTableGroup,
  FgOakCrownExpansionFactor, FgOakPieceMassRecord, FgOakRecordMaker

*	25/07/2006
- added "medianDiameter_cm" to GPiece.propertyNames
- added to export file the log value (in Euros) according to 
  Sébastien Cavaignac 2003 models
- added class FgOakLogPriceModel
