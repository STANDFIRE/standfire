## DETimeCrobasBiomass labels - French

## DETimeCrobasBiomass
DETimeCrobasBiomass = Compartment biomasses

DETimeCrobasBiomass.xLabel = Time
DETimeCrobasBiomass.yLabel = Biomass (kg)

showWf = Display Wf: foliage biomass
showWb = Display Wb: sapwood biomass in the branches
showWs = Display Ws: sapwood biomass in the stem
showWr = Display Wr: fine root biomass
showWt = Display Wt: sapwood biomass in the transport roots

DETimeCrobasBiomass.description = Compartment biomasses as predicted by Crobas: Wf (foliage), Wb (branch), Ws (sapwood in stem), Wr (fine roots), Wt (transport roots).
