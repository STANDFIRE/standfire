EconomicModelTool.dateExplanation1 = The given date will refer to stand after intervention. \n For example, if 2010 is chosen as first year, then all income, expanse and intervention \n that occur in 2010 will be included in the scenario.
EconomicModelTool.dateExplanation2 = The events occurring that year will be included in the transitory period \n and not be included in the cyclic period. 
EconomicModelTool.dateExplanation3 = The given date will refer to stand after intervention. \n For example, if 2010 is chosen as last year, then all income, expanse and intervention \n that occur in 2010 will be included in the scenario.
