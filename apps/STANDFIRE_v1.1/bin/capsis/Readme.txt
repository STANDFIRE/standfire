Capsis

-> Computer-Aided Projection for Strategies in Silviculture
-> Croissance d'Arbres en Peuplement avec Simulation d'Itinéraires Sylvicoles

Capsis is a free generic computer platform to simulate forests / plantations 
growth / dynamics and silvicultural treatments for decision making in forest 
management, forestry research and for educational purposes.

This software is fully functional but may contain only few models: models with 
a free licence for the web demo version, or models selected by the modeller
who gave you the installer. If you are a scientist interested in integrating 
your own model in Capsis and thus have access to all the integrated models 
according to the Capsis Charter, please have a look at the documentation 
pages on the capsis web site and then contact coligny@cirad.fr to join 
the project.

Capsis runs on Java platforms and is tested under Windows, Linux and Mac.

Check the Capsis web site http://www.inra.fr/capsis where you will find more 
information and the Capsis Charter which must be accepted by all users. 

See also the Installation Guide and the Capsis Tutorial.

Capsis is being developed at the AMAP research unity (Cirad, CNRS, INRA, IRD, 
Université Montpellier 2 - botAnique et Modélisation de l'Architecture 
des Plantes et des végétations) in Montpellier, France.
