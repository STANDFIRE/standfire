Compilation/Installation instructions 
1)      Make sure the following python dependencies are installed on your machine 
	a. Python 2.7.13
	b. GDAL==2.1.3 
	c. pandas==0.19.1 
	d.  numpy>=1.7.0  (needed for pandas)
	e.  python-dateutil ==Any version (needed for pandas)
	f.  six>=1.5  (needed for pandas)
	g.  pytz>=2011k  (needed for pandas)
	h. Pyinstaller==3.2.1
	i.  Future==Any version (needed for pyinstaller)
	j.  Setuptools== Any version (needed for pyinstaller)
2)      If you have pip (usually located in C:\Python27\Scripts\) you can easily 
		check out what is installed on your machine by installing pipdeptree
		Using a cmd window navigate to wherever pip is and use the command 
		<pip install pipdeptree> Then run it from the same location: <pipdeptree.exe>
3)      You really only need to install GDAL, pandas and pyinstaller as they 
		will fetch their own dependencies. Pandas and pyinstaller can also be 
		installed by pip. GDAL is a whole ‘nother ball of wax. I would suggest 
		following the instructions on this webpage: 
		https://sandbox.idre.ucla.edu/sandbox/tutorials/installing-gdal-for-windows 
		very carefully.
4)      Download the standfire repository (‘Clone or Download’ button) and unzip it 
		wherever you like.
5)      Edit the .spec file found in ../apps/STANDFIRE_v1.1/ : change the path in the 
		pathex list to reflect where this directory is found on your machine.
6)      Build the program by pointing pyinstaller at the .spec file (from the 
		directory where the .spec file is located: 
		<C:\Python27\Scripts\pyinstaller.exe standfire_mini_interface.spec> )
7)      Once it is built, copy the bin, data and pyfvs directories from …/apps/ 
		to …/apps/STANDFIRE_v1.0/dist/standfire_mini_interface/
8)      Run standfire_mini_interface.exe
