Reflects changes from version 1.1.0a to 1.1.1a

- modified spacing throughout the script to come in line with PEP recommendations

- replaced call to lidar.py:Convert_Lidar:spatial_join method with calls to 
	several methods (copy_shapefile, cleanup_lidar_fields, fishnet_id and
	cleanup_lidar_features) which replace spatial join for the purpose of 
	eliminating the use of the ogr2ogr.exe binary.
