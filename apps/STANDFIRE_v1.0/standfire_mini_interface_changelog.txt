July, 2017
Reflects changes from version 1.0.0a to 1.1.0a

-added import for new lidar (lidar.py) module

-added lidar_get_shapefile method. Opens file dialog and stores user
	selected filename in lidar_entry box.

-added 'filetype' option to get_keyword_file method to restrict displayed
	files to *.key or *.*.

-added toggle_ldr_check method. Checks whether the 'Enable LiDAR Run box
	is checked, enables or disables GUI elements as appropriate and 
	populates/depopulates GUI entry fields as appropriate.

-modified update_domain_change method:
	-removed hard-wired numbers to accomadate both standard and lidar
	 simulations.
	-added x & y Area Of Interest (AOI) variable for use in calculating
	 x & y offsets.
	-added y offset variable
	-added pathways to calculate various dimensions for both standard 
	 and lidar runs.
	-changed the methodology for calculating WFDS igniter location and
	 dimensions.

- added run_button method. Runs either a standard or lidar FVS simulation 
	method (run_standard or run_lidar) depending on user specification.
	Also runs run_etal which runs CAPSIS and WFDS for either type of 
	simulation.

-split the run method into run_standard and capsis_etal methods and added the
	run_lidar method.
	The run_lidar method processes the input shapefile, runs multiple
	64 x 64m FVS simulations and collates the FVS simulation results.

-modified the capsis_etal (formally a part of the run method) to 1) set the 
	'extend' parameter for capsis to True (standard run) or False 
	(lidar run) and 2) to pass on new variables required by the WFDS class
	constructor (__init__) method.

-added the following variables to the create_variables method:
	-ldr_check_var - t/f lidar run checkbox
	-lidar_shapefile - input lidar shapefile path and name
	-x_AOI_size - x Area Of Interest size
	-y_AOI_size - y AOI size

-added the following variables to the reset method:
	-lidar_check_var (uncheck)
	-lidar_shapefile (clear)
	-shape_entry (disable)
	-shp_brws_btn (disable)
	-x_entry (enable)
	-y_entry (enable)
	-x_AOI_size (64)
	-y_AOI_size (64)

-deleted the clear method. This method set all input variables to an empty
	string. This could cause some bugs in the program down the road and
	we decided to eliminate it.

-added the following to the GUI:
	-'Enable LiDAR Run' checkbox
	-'Specify LiDAR shapefile' string entry box
	-'Browse' button (to browse for LiDAR shapefile)

-added the the 'lidar panel' to the create_widgets method (includes the above
	GUI additions and associated text prompts)

-deleted the clear button from the create_widgets method (see above)

-added the lidar panel items (see above) to the grid_widgets method. Adjusted
	adjusted the positioning of other GUI elements as necessary.

-deleted the clear button from the grid_widgets method.



August, 2017
Reflects changes from version 1.1.0a to 1.1.1a

- modified spacing throughout the script to come in line with PEP recommendations

- replaced call to lidar.py:Convert_Lidar:spatial_join method with calls to 
	several methods (copy_shapefile, cleanup_lidar_fields, fishnet_id and
	cleanup_lidar_features) which replace spatial join for the purpose of 
	eliminating the use of the ogr2ogr.exe binary.
