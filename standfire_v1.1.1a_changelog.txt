-eliminated the use of the GDAL binary ogr2ogr.exe to make its functions platform
	neutral and speed up processing time.

- replaced the '_write_vrt_file' and 'spatial_join' methods from standfire ver 1.1.0a
	with 'copy_shapefile', 'cleanup_lidar_fields', 'fishnet_id' and 
	'cleanup_lidar_features' to facilitate the elimination of the ogr2ogr binary.

- modified the __init__ method to eliminate the definition of the path to ogr2ogr.exe

- modified spacing throughout the script to come in line with PEP recommendations

- deleted the addition of the 'Plot_ID' field from the 'add_attribute_fields' method.
	This field is now added and populated in the 'fishnet_id' method.

- eliminated the populating of the 'Plot_ID' field from the 'calculate_attributes'
	method for the reasons listed above.

	has been replaced by basic ogr functions in several methods in lidar.py
	(see above).
