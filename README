### Coding conventions

#### Naming

Camle case is ugly!!!

*variables* - all lower case, separate distinct pieces of the variable name with an underscore if it improves readibility.

```
>>> canopy_base_ht = 14.5
>>> crwdth = 3.42
```

*functions and methods* - 

*classes* - the exception to the **camle case is ugly rule**.

```
>>> class FvsFuels(object):
```

*constants* - all upper case with words separated by an underscore.

```
>>> MAX_WIND_SPEED = 20
```
