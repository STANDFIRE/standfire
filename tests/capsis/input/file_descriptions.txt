% snagdbh (inches)
% snaglen (feet)
% snagfdir is the direction of fall, if -1 then the tree is standing.
% snagstat is a snag status code: I need to look up the codes but they may not be useful. I think 2 is hard and 3 is soft.
% snagwt0 :  Foliage wt (lbs)
% snagwt1 : <0.25"      (lbs)
% snagwt2 :  0.25" -   1" (lbs)

% cwd.csv:
% xloc, yloc: locations within a 1 acre square, measured in feet --  square is 208.7103 feet on a side.
% cwddia -- diameter (inches)
% cwdlen -- length (feet)
% cwdpil is a code that say if the cwd is in a pile or not (this is a FFE management action), 0 is not piled, I think 1 is piled.
% cwddir -- direction in degrees
% cwdwt is the weight -- in tons
